# Passwordgenerator-Python
# Password Generator Project Description
Objective: Create a Python program that generates strong and random passwords based on user specifications.

## Features:

Generate passwords of variable length.
Include options for including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Allow customization of the password criteria based on user preferences.

## Function generate_password:
Uses string module to define sets of characters (lowercase_letters, uppercase_letters, digits, special_characters).
Combines character sets based on user preferences (include_uppercase, include_digits, include_special).
Generates a random password of specified length using random.choice.

## Main program:
Prompts the user for password criteria such as length and inclusion of uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Calls generate_password function with user-provided inputs.
Displays the generated password to the user.

## Usage:
Run the script.
Enter desired criteria for the password generation when prompted (length, inclusion of uppercase letters, digits, and special characters).
The script will generate a random password based on the provided criteria and display it to the user.

## Notes:
This example provides a basic implementation of a password generator. Depending on your needs, you may want to enhance it further by adding additional features such as saving generated passwords to a file, ensuring password strength criteria (e.g., minimum requirements for each character type), or creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
